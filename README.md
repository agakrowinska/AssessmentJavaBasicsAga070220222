Hello Safwan

#### I have decided to create registration service for imaginary St Barbara Hospital employees.

My project is initialized as Sprin project.

I used in my project:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Thymeleaf
- JavaMail

The application let new Doctors register to hospital's intranet.
On landing page they have to click on the link to register. 


Then they are going to the page where they can enter ther first and last name as well as email and password for the account. 

After correctly putting the information they are being redirected to Internal Personal Website. 

At the same time they are getting e-mail to the provided email address where they have to click the link to activate account.
